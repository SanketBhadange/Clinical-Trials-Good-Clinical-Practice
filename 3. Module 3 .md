# 1. How does clinical trial research make a difference?

Understanding clinical trials. Every clinical trial participant is making a difference.?
- Each trial phase, from phase one to four, builds on the previous phase and adds to the body of scientific evidence for the treatment.
- Let's hear from some patients who have taken part in clinical trials on why they think clinical trial research makes a difference.
-  Clinical trial research makes a difference in everyone's life. Anytime you go into a drugstore and fill a prescription, that drug has been on a clinical trial.
  - If there's no research, there's no answer. If there's no research, there's no hope for advancement.
  - It definitely makes a big difference. It might not feel like it because you're just one person, but collectively, it makes an impact. It might not work in this decade or the next, but maybe 20 years down the line, someone will read all this data that has been collected and then add to it and make it better, and then maybe it'll work 30 years from now. So either way, it's going to help, it's going to help people.
  - Every time you sign up for a clinical trial, you are giving the medical community more knowledge. You are giving the patients who will come after you a better understanding of what medicines work for them.
  - It makes a difference because you could be improving the quality of life in thousands, if not millions of people.


# 2. What's it like to be part of a clinical trial

Let's hear from some patients who have taken part in a clinical trial on what it was like for them to be in a clinical trial. 
Note that individual clinical trial experiences may vary from what is presented. 
- When you hear clinical trial, you'll think, I'm just going to be a guinea pig, and they're just going to experiment on me, but that's not what it was at all. It was total opposite.
- I've been in four, and they were kind of self selected by myself and my doctor.
- Being on a trial was a difficult and a hopeful journey. It was difficult because we didn't know what was going to happen. Failure was certainly something that was possible, and no one could let me know what it was going to be like to be the first patient. On this combination of therapies, there's been a lot of ups and downs, both medically and situationally. Clinical trials aren't always the easiest things.
- Every time I go for an appointment, which is every two months, they always ask me again and again, like, are you sure you want to continue on this trial? You know, do you have any concerns? It's kind of like having a second mom, because they just want to make sure that you're okay and that the side effects you're going through aren't too much for you.
- I felt safe in any facility that I've ever participated in the clinical trial because I feel like doctors don't go into it to harm you. They really do go into it to make things better for you. If you have an adverse event, I mean, they make sure that they address it as soon as possible. So I've never had any fear or had any worry about it not being safe for me. >>
- You can stop participating in a clinical trial at any point in time you feel like you need to.
- All clinical trials have risks, and you should really understand before you agree and consent.
