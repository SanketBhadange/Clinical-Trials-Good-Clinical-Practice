# 1. How does clinical trial research make a difference?

Understanding clinical trials. Every clinical trial participant is making a difference.?
- Each trial phase, from phase one to four, builds on the previous phase and adds to the body of scientific evidence for the treatment.
- Let's hear from some patients who have taken part in clinical trials on why they think clinical trial research makes a difference.
-  Clinical trial research makes a difference in everyone's life. Anytime you go into a drugstore and fill a prescription, that drug has been on a clinical trial.
  - If there's no research, there's no answer. If there's no research, there's no hope for advancement.
  - It definitely makes a big difference. It might not feel like it because you're just one person, but collectively, it makes an impact. It might not work in this decade or the next, but maybe 20 years down the line, someone will read all this data that has been collected and then add to it and make it better, and then maybe it'll work 30 years from now. So either way, it's going to help, it's going to help people.
  - Every time you sign up for a clinical trial, you are giving the medical community more knowledge. You are giving the patients who will come after you a better understanding of what medicines work for them.
  - It makes a difference because you could be improving the quality of life in thousands, if not millions of people.


# 2. What's it like to be part of a clinical trial

Let's hear from some patients who have taken part in a clinical trial on what it was like for them to be in a clinical trial. 
Note that individual clinical trial experiences may vary from what is presented. 
- When you hear clinical trial, you'll think, I'm just going to be a guinea pig, and they're just going to experiment on me, but that's not what it was at all. It was total opposite.
- I've been in four, and they were kind of self selected by myself and my doctor.
- Being on a trial was a difficult and a hopeful journey. It was difficult because we didn't know what was going to happen. Failure was certainly something that was possible, and no one could let me know what it was going to be like to be the first patient. On this combination of therapies, there's been a lot of ups and downs, both medically and situationally. Clinical trials aren't always the easiest things.
- Every time I go for an appointment, which is every two months, they always ask me again and again, like, are you sure you want to continue on this trial? You know, do you have any concerns? It's kind of like having a second mom, because they just want to make sure that you're okay and that the side effects you're going through aren't too much for you.
- I felt safe in any facility that I've ever participated in the clinical trial because I feel like doctors don't go into it to harm you. They really do go into it to make things better for you. If you have an adverse event, I mean, they make sure that they address it as soon as possible. So I've never had any fear or had any worry about it not being safe for me. >>
- You can stop participating in a clinical trial at any point in time you feel like you need to.
- All clinical trials have risks, and you should really understand before you agree and consent. 


# 3. What is the process for Dr. Novel taking part in a clinical trial?

It's great that you're interested in clinical research. Perhaps I can talk you through some of the next steps. >>
- Perfect, let's talk a bit more about the focus trial. >>
-  After you've signed the confidentiality agreement, I'll send you the protocol and investigators brochure. Take your time and read through it, then get back to me if you have any questions. >>
-  The protocol describes the procedures that need to be followed for a patient, right? >>
-  Exactly, mainly, it provides a scientific background, the trial objective and purpose, and the selection criteria for the patient treatment regime. It also provides the trial procedures. But don't worry, we'll be discussing those in a lot more detail later. >>


-  So what does the investigator's brochure contain? >>
-   Well, the brochure will provide you with insights on the compound. It's a compilation of the clinical and nonclinical drug data. It will help you understand the drug safety profile based on what is known so far. It contains information related to physical and chemical pharmacological properties and formulation, pharmacokinetics product metabolism in humans and in animals, as well as the safety and efficacy data. This will help you decide whether you would like to participate in the trial. And if you do decide to participate, it will help you to assess all the safety and efficacy relevant information. For example, what happens if a participant experiences an adverse event? >>

-   Is there anything else I need to know? >>
-   As you're reading through the protocol, it would be good to really think about whether you have the qualified personnel to manage the trial conduct on site. Also, you need to think about whether you have the right equipment, like a centrifuge freezers or anything else needed to perform the trial related procedures. We always recommend that you have a coinvestigator who can provide medical expertise in case you're not on site. A study coordinator is also very helpful to take care of the logistics and documentation during the trial. You'll see, the protocol also requires other resources like pharmacist and laboratory personnel. Of course, these people will receive additional training for the specific trial requirements, but they should be qualified to perform the task. >>
-
-   Okay, I'll have to discuss this with my team, but I'm confident that we have the right resources to support conducting the trial. One more question. Obviously, I have no experience in handling this new drug. Where can I find more information about it? >>
-   You'll find general information about the investigational medicinal products in the investigator's brochure provided by the sponsor. The protocol will provide more in depth requirements, such as the dosage and route of administration. [MUSIC] >>
-    Thanks a lot, I'll read through the protocol and the brochure and get back to you if I have any questions.


# 4. How do patients get involved in clinical trials?

Understanding clinical trials. Let's ask some patients who have participated in clinical trials, and what are some ways they suggest to get into a clinical trial? 

- One of the ways you can do to get into a clinical trial is to go to clinicaltrials.gov. There's a listing of all of them. You search on the disease state or the condition that you're looking for, and it will give you a list of the ones that are recruiting or have already been done.
- The best way, I would say, to get into a clinical trial would be to ask your doctor.
- Personally, I have a relationship with my principal investigator at my institution, so I have the privilege of being presented clinical trials on a routine basis. However, there are wonderful resources to find clinical trials.
- Getting into clinical trial is a multi-step process. The first part of the process is understanding your diagnosis, what your current treatment options are, and then researching what clinical trial drugs or treatments may be available.
-  If you're thinking about a clinical trial, understand the benefits and the risks, get informed. 


# 5.Diversity in clinical trials

- Clinical trials provide valuable information about the safety and efficacy of medicines. These insights allow us to determine the best possible use of each medicine and how different groups of patients respond to them. To get the best possible insights, we need trial participants who accurately reflect the population. However, the research enterprise is failing to attract and retain patient participants representative of those who will ultimately receive a treatment once it's available. 
- While racial and ethnic minorities make up 38.7% of the US population, rates of inclusion in trials range from a high of 16% to as low as 2%.
- For example, African American participation rates in the US are lower than 5%, despite a 14% greater risk of dying from cancer.
- Latinos make up only 1% of clinical trial participants, but 18% of the population as a whole.
-  Without diverse clinical trial populations, we are left with unanswered questions about the impact of factors such as race, ethnicity, age, and gender on treatment response and side effect profiles.
-  This leaves doctors without the data they need to make the best treatment decisions for every patient.
-  A person's age, genetics, racial, and ethnic origin, and even geographic location can all play a role in which diseases affect that person.
-  These factors can also affect how therapy works and how safe it is.
-  For example, Alzheimer's disease happens twice as often in women than in men.
-  Type 2 diabetes and hypertension are more common among African Americans and Hispanics than in any other races and ethnic groups.
-  Liver disease is more common in Hispanics than in other ethnic groups, and in some cases, children respond differently to treatments than adults do.
-  Participants can also respond differently to the same treatment. Research has even found that one out of every five FDA approved drugs showed interracial and/or ethnic variability in the response and safety.
-   One such example of different responses to a treatment is warfarin, a blood thinner, which given correctly helps prevent blood clots that can lead to strokes or pulmonary embolism.
-   However, too much warfarin can lead to excessive bleeding.
-   Populations with African ancestry are more likely to require higher average daily doses of warfarin, while patients with Asian ancestries tend to need less.
-   This important knowledge can prevent patients receiving no benefit from the drug because they have been underdosed or from suffering the side effects of an overdose. Although recruiting a diverse community of study volunteers remains a challenge, it's necessary to address health disparities.
-   The regulatory environment is changing to support that and increasingly focuses on diversity.
-   Since January 2022, the New England Journal of Medicine, one of the most prestigious peer-reviewed medical journals, has required a demographic breakdown of disease information.
-   Additionally, the FDA introduced specific guidance in April 2022, requesting sponsors submit diversity plans for their trials, which set diversity goals and outline tactics to meet them. Federal law has since been passed, which now obliges sponsors to present diversity plans for all clinical trials in Phase 3 or beyond.
-   The more diverse the patients in clinical trials, the more research is gathered about what makes people sick or keeps them healthy.
-   A recent report from the National Academy of Sciences says that the inclusion of women and historically excluded groups will lead to improved health and well-being in the US population overall. This is the underlying reason why there's increased regulatory focus in this area. There's also a scientific reason.
-   These days, we increasingly rely on precision medicine to target the right treatments to the right patients at the right time, especially by using genetic and molecular profiling.
-   Yet 80% of the data in the largest genomic databases is from people with European ancestry. By ensuring that all patients are represented in trials, we will increase our ability to identify biomarkers to assess risk, prognosis, and therapeutic response.
-   A study published in the Journal of Healthcare for the poor and underserved found that mistrust of healthcare systems is the primary barrier to participation in medical research among African American adults.
-   This is rooted in socioeconomic disparities, bred from centuries of systemic racism and medical exploitation.
-   Take, for example, the infamous Tuskegee Experiment in which 600 poor African Americans with syphilis were promised free medical care. While syphilis was untreatable at the study start, after 15 years, penicillin became a standard of care but was withheld from participants to examine untreated disease progression.
-   Or the Mississippi Appendectomy that involves the forced sterilization of poor black women without their knowledge under the guise of appendectomies as hysterectomy training for young doctors.
-   Even today, implicit bias still exists in healthcare, fueling mistrust.
-   At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, pulse oximeters overestimated the oxygen levels in darker skin patients. These inaccuracies led to life-threatening delays in the treatment of black and brown patients.
-   Socioeconomic barriers can also prevent people from accessing healthcare due to not having time off for medical appointments or not being able to afford the time and costs associated with transportation, if clinical trial sites are located far from where they live. In the US, 52% of FDA trials are run in 1.5% of ZIP codes, resulting in preferential inclusion of a small portion of the population. There are even biases among physicians themselves. Many doctors don't talk to their patients about clinical trials due to their lack of time or language barriers or because they assume that a trial would be inconvenient or not of interest to the patient. As a medical community, we need to build trust with patients and engage more diverse populations so they're more comfortable participating in trials. Expanding our trial sites to those which serve diverse communities is key to the enrollment of more diverse patients. We are also working to address disparities in the workforce, as we believe that increasing the number of black doctors is another factor that may produce disparate health outcomes affecting African American patients. African Americans make up 13% of the US population, but only 4% of doctors and less than 7% of medical students. It's crucial to address this shortage as multiple studies have shown that patients more easily trust doctors who are from their communities, which may lead to more effective healthcare, including clinical trial participation.


# 6. Why patients might be excluded from clinical trials

Understanding clinical trials. Why are some people excluded from clinical trials? 

- Clinical studies have standards outlining who can participate.
- These standards are called eligibility criteria, also known as inclusion/exclusion criteria, and are listed in the study plan.
- Some research studies seek participants who have the illnesses or conditions that will be studied. Other studies are looking for healthy participants.
-  Factors that disqualify someone from participating are called exclusion criteria.
-  Characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions are examples of criteria that may be outlined in the inclusion or exclusion criteria.
-  Let's hear from others on how they would describe this.
-  Clinical trial is a research study, and you need to have a certain type of population participating in the clinical trial according to certain parameter.
-  Exclusion criterias of a clinical trial are there to ensure that patients who are not right for the trial are not included. It could be age. It could be gender. It could be the health status of a patient.
-  You may be too old. You may be too young. It may be that you have some complications that would eliminate you from being a good candidate. Different clinical trials have different exclusion and inclusion criterias, so there may be one that's right for you. Learn more at clinicaltrials.novartis.com.


# 7.A patient's story

- Clinical trials are important. Most treatments available today were studied in clinical trials.
- Choosing to be a part of a clinical trial is a personal decision. You should discuss the option with your doctor and loved ones.
- Let's hear from one clinical trial participant and her story. All clinical trials involve risks.
- I think the number 1 reason why I chose to start the clinical trial was not even for myself, but more for my family and my two daughters, in particular. When my eight-year-old was around five years old, there was one day that we were supposed to go to a carnival. We were all so excited to go to the carnival, and she's, my God, is this Saturday yet? I woke up that day, and I couldn't walk. I couldn't get out of bed. I told her I'm not going to be able to go with you. Let's see if someone else could take you or whatever, and
- she's just, no, I want you to go. It was just like I broke her heart because she wanted to go to that carnival so bad, and that day she sat next to me and looked at me and just said, I don't want a sick mom.
- After that, I made it my mission to just try and look for options for other ways in which to better my health, and when the opportunity presented itself for me to come on board with a clinical trial, it was a no-brainer for me. If I can be that example for her of not giving up and just keep fighting for whatever it is, in my case, my life, that'll motivate her for years to come. She can look back at this period in our lives and say, well, my mom didn't give up. I refuse to give up. This is just my way of not giving up. Learn more at clinicaltrials.novartis.com.
