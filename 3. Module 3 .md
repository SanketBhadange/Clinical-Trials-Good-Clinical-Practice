# 1. How does clinical trial research make a difference?

Understanding clinical trials. Every clinical trial participant is making a difference.?
- Each trial phase, from phase one to four, builds on the previous phase and adds to the body of scientific evidence for the treatment.
- Let's hear from some patients who have taken part in clinical trials on why they think clinical trial research makes a difference.
-  Clinical trial research makes a difference in everyone's life. Anytime you go into a drugstore and fill a prescription, that drug has been on a clinical trial.
  - If there's no research, there's no answer. If there's no research, there's no hope for advancement.
  - It definitely makes a big difference. It might not feel like it because you're just one person, but collectively, it makes an impact. It might not work in this decade or the next, but maybe 20 years down the line, someone will read all this data that has been collected and then add to it and make it better, and then maybe it'll work 30 years from now. So either way, it's going to help, it's going to help people.
  - Every time you sign up for a clinical trial, you are giving the medical community more knowledge. You are giving the patients who will come after you a better understanding of what medicines work for them.
  - It makes a difference because you could be improving the quality of life in thousands, if not millions of people.


# 2. What's it like to be part of a clinical trial

Let's hear from some patients who have taken part in a clinical trial on what it was like for them to be in a clinical trial. 
Note that individual clinical trial experiences may vary from what is presented. 
- When you hear clinical trial, you'll think, I'm just going to be a guinea pig, and they're just going to experiment on me, but that's not what it was at all. It was total opposite.
- I've been in four, and they were kind of self selected by myself and my doctor.
- Being on a trial was a difficult and a hopeful journey. It was difficult because we didn't know what was going to happen. Failure was certainly something that was possible, and no one could let me know what it was going to be like to be the first patient. On this combination of therapies, there's been a lot of ups and downs, both medically and situationally. Clinical trials aren't always the easiest things.
- Every time I go for an appointment, which is every two months, they always ask me again and again, like, are you sure you want to continue on this trial? You know, do you have any concerns? It's kind of like having a second mom, because they just want to make sure that you're okay and that the side effects you're going through aren't too much for you.
- I felt safe in any facility that I've ever participated in the clinical trial because I feel like doctors don't go into it to harm you. They really do go into it to make things better for you. If you have an adverse event, I mean, they make sure that they address it as soon as possible. So I've never had any fear or had any worry about it not being safe for me. >>
- You can stop participating in a clinical trial at any point in time you feel like you need to.
- All clinical trials have risks, and you should really understand before you agree and consent. 


# 3. What is the process for Dr. Novel taking part in a clinical trial?

It's great that you're interested in clinical research. Perhaps I can talk you through some of the next steps. >>
- Perfect, let's talk a bit more about the focus trial. >>
-  After you've signed the confidentiality agreement, I'll send you the protocol and investigators brochure. Take your time and read through it, then get back to me if you have any questions. >>
-  The protocol describes the procedures that need to be followed for a patient, right? >>
-  Exactly, mainly, it provides a scientific background, the trial objective and purpose, and the selection criteria for the patient treatment regime. It also provides the trial procedures. But don't worry, we'll be discussing those in a lot more detail later. >>


-  So what does the investigator's brochure contain? >>
-   Well, the brochure will provide you with insights on the compound. It's a compilation of the clinical and nonclinical drug data. It will help you understand the drug safety profile based on what is known so far. It contains information related to physical and chemical pharmacological properties and formulation, pharmacokinetics product metabolism in humans and in animals, as well as the safety and efficacy data. This will help you decide whether you would like to participate in the trial. And if you do decide to participate, it will help you to assess all the safety and efficacy relevant information. For example, what happens if a participant experiences an adverse event? >>

-   Is there anything else I need to know? >>
-   As you're reading through the protocol, it would be good to really think about whether you have the qualified personnel to manage the trial conduct on site. Also, you need to think about whether you have the right equipment, like a centrifuge freezers or anything else needed to perform the trial related procedures. We always recommend that you have a coinvestigator who can provide medical expertise in case you're not on site. A study coordinator is also very helpful to take care of the logistics and documentation during the trial. You'll see, the protocol also requires other resources like pharmacist and laboratory personnel. Of course, these people will receive additional training for the specific trial requirements, but they should be qualified to perform the task. >>
-
-   Okay, I'll have to discuss this with my team, but I'm confident that we have the right resources to support conducting the trial. One more question. Obviously, I have no experience in handling this new drug. Where can I find more information about it? >>
-   You'll find general information about the investigational medicinal products in the investigator's brochure provided by the sponsor. The protocol will provide more in depth requirements, such as the dosage and route of administration. [MUSIC] >>
-    Thanks a lot, I'll read through the protocol and the brochure and get back to you if I have any questions.


# 4. How do patients get involved in clinical trials?

Understanding clinical trials. Let's ask some patients who have participated in clinical trials, and what are some ways they suggest to get into a clinical trial? 

- One of the ways you can do to get into a clinical trial is to go to clinicaltrials.gov. There's a listing of all of them. You search on the disease state or the condition that you're looking for, and it will give you a list of the ones that are recruiting or have already been done.
- The best way, I would say, to get into a clinical trial would be to ask your doctor.
- Personally, I have a relationship with my principal investigator at my institution, so I have the privilege of being presented clinical trials on a routine basis. However, there are wonderful resources to find clinical trials.
- Getting into clinical trial is a multi-step process. The first part of the process is understanding your diagnosis, what your current treatment options are, and then researching what clinical trial drugs or treatments may be available.
-  If you're thinking about a clinical trial, understand the benefits and the risks, get informed.
