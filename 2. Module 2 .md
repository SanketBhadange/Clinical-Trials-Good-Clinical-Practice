# 1. Definitions of words used in clinical trials:

Understanding clinical trials. Definitions of words used in clinical trial descriptions. 

 ### What is standard of care? 
- Treatment that is currently available and widely accepted by health care professionals as the proper course of action is called standard of care. Some clinical trials measure investigational products against the current standard of care.

### What is randomization?
-    Randomization is the process of randomly assigning clinical trial participants into separate groups that compare different treatments or interventions. This process is done by computer in order to help ensure unbiased results and compare the effects of the treatments more fairly.

### What is a placebo?
-   In a clinical trial, you may receive a product that's a placebo or a placebo with standard of care, which is a substance that has no effect. This is given to ensure there's no bias in a trial, and so that researchers can compare the effectiveness of existing care options versus investigational therapy.

### What does it mean if a study is blinded?
-  A blinded study is a study in which the patients and/or the researchers do not know which drug or treatment is being given.

### What is an open label study?
-  An open label study is the opposite of a blinded study, because participants and researchers are fully aware of the treatments being given.

###  What about confidentiality in a clinical trial?
-    Some information related to personal health information is collected. It's very important that this remain confidential.

# 2. Medical care vs clinical research .

Dr Novel: Hi Monica, Hope you’re well!
Monica: Great thanks! How R U?
Dr Novel: I’m good! Just wondering.... 
### Do you pls have a definition of the difference between medical care and medical research?

Monica: 
-Sure As clinical research is part of the drug development process, it’s very different to standard medical care 
-Medical care is intended to benefit and help a specific patient using accepted procedures and product 
-Clinical research leads to medical advances and knowledge gain

Dr Novel: Thanks!

Monica: No problem :-) Also important: We want to learn about the disease, the drug and its effects based on a risk-benefit assessment for the trial participants

Here: Screen shot from Monica ICH GCP 2.2 Before a trial is initiated, foreseeable risks and inconveniences should be weighed against the anticipated benefit for the individual trial subject and society. A trial should be initiated and continued only if the anticipated benefits justify the risks

Monica: Also, for clinical trials you need written informed consent from every participant before you administer the Investigational Medicinal Product. In Medical practice you don’t because the product is already approved. Monica screen shot ICH GCP 2.9: Freely given informed consent should be obtained from every subject prior to trial investigation

Dr Novel: Perfect thanks, that’s helpful Speak soon!
Monica: You’re welcome!


# 3. What are the risks and benefits of clinical trials?

Understanding clinical trials what are the risks and benefits of clinical trials?

-Taking part in a trial may or may not improve your health.
-Most trials involve some risk of harm or injury, including serious or even life threatening side effects. 
-So be sure to discuss these issues with members of the research team and with your healthcare provider.
-All treatments have side effects, and the investigational treatment may have risks or side effects that the doctors do not know about. The investigational treatment may not be as effective as standard care or may not be effective at all. 
-The investigational treatment may not work for you even if it has worked in others.

Let's see what others have to say. >> One can never assume that a clinical trial is safe. 
-There are always risks associated with administration of a drug. Potential participants need to be fully aware of all the risks and potential benefits. >> 
-There are a number of risks and benefits for joining a clinical trial. The most obvious risk is that the medical community doesn't know how the treatment will work. 
-There are risks of side effects, and they will be very well spelled out for you, but you need to be much more diligent in managing your health care. -You may participate in a clinical trial that may have really bad side effects. 
-The risks of a clinical trial are always discussed with the patients because some of them can be fatal, and we want to make sure that you're making that informed decision. 

-But the positive thing that you can get from doing a clinical trial is the advancement of a drug, device or procedure. 
-A lot of the drug trials that I've been on have helped in my own disease modification. 
-Definitely give it a go. It might surprise you, you know, you might actually end up getting better. 
>> Just because a trial works for one person, doesn't mean it's going to work for everybody. That's one of the foundations of clinical research is that, we just don't know what's going to work.
>> >> All clinical trials have risks, and you should really understand before you agree and consent. 


# 4. The history of Good Clinical Practice and why it matters.

### What is Good Clinical Practice (GCP)?
-An international ethical and scientific quality standard


-Good clinical practice or GCP is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, recording, and reporting trials that involve the participation of human subjects. 
-It helps make sure that the results of a clinical trial are reliable, and that the patient's rights, safety, and well being are protected. 
-Good clinical practice covers the way a clinical trial is designed, conducted, recorded, monitored, audited, analyzed, and reported.
-Good clinical practice guidelines are issued by the ICH or International Council for harmonization of technical requirements for pharmaceuticals for human use. 
-The ICH brings together regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry to discuss scientific and technical aspects of pharmaceuticals and set an industry standard. 
-The creation of good clinical practice guidelines as they are today was triggered by several terrible medical events. 
-In America, it began in 1937, when a new liquid version of the antibiotic formula, elixir sulfanilamide was created. 
-It was commonly used to treat sore throats. At the time, the food and drug laws in the USA did not require safety studies on new drugs. 
-The formula, with its new combination of ingredients, had not been tested for toxicity. 
-The drug was responsible for the deaths of over 100 people, many of them children across 15 states. 
-Following the tragedy, Congress created the 1938 Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. 
-The Act gave the United States a system of drug control, which provided more protection while stimulating medical research and progress. 
-The atrocities of World War II sparked the development of international guidelines following the Nuremberg trials. 
-During these trials, 23 German physicians and administrators were prosecuted for performing inhumane experiments on prisoners in concentration camps in the name of medical science. 
-The defendants argued their innocence, noting that there were no formal laws in place or even informal statements suggesting that these experiments should not be carried out. 
-As a direct result of the trials, the Nuremberg Code was established in 1947, stating that The voluntary consent of the human participant is absolutely essential, making it clear that participants should give consent and that the benefits of research must outweigh the risks.
-" The next year in 1948, the World Medical Association's Declaration of Geneva outlined every physician's ethical duty.
 
-In the 1960s, an international tragedy was a catalyst for the introduction of tighter rules and regulations worldwide. 
-Marketed as a drug that helped ease anxiety, trouble sleeping and morning sickness, thalidomide was prescribed in 46 countries to women who were pregnant or who subsequently became pregnant, resulting in the biggest man-made medical disaster ever, with more than 10,000 children born with a range of severe deformities. 
-The disaster prompted many countries to introduce tougher rules for the testing and licensing of drugs. 

-In 1964, an evolution of the Declaration of Geneva and the Nuremberg Code formed the basis of the Declaration of Helsinki. It is considered the first GCP principle issued by the World Medical Association and has been revised continuously over the decades. 
-Throughout the 1960s and 70s, as country specific laws and regulations continued to increase dramatically, the pharmaceutical industry was becoming more global. However, technical requirements from country to country varied wildly, meaning the industry had to duplicate time consuming and expensive test procedures to enter new international markets. 
-Not only did this increase medical research and development costs, but it also delayed getting treatments to patients. 
-The birth of ICH took place at a meeting in Brussels in April 1990, following the successful implementation of standardized guidelines in Europe during the 1980s. 
-With international regulators and pharmaceutical companies working together, the core principles of ICH GCP began to take shape. 
-ICH GCP is now followed by the vast majority of countries around the world. 
-This global harmonization has ensured that more medicines get to more patients more quickly while protecting the rights and safety of patients.


# 5. What is informed consent?

- Understanding clinical trials. What is informed consent?
- A process used by researchers to communicate to potential and enrolled participants the risks and potential benefits of participating in a clinical study.
-  Informed consent is a process that includes all of these steps.
-  You are told or get information in some way about the possible risks and benefits of the treatment.
-   You are told about the risks and benefits of other options, including not getting treatment.
-   You have the chance to ask questions and get them answered to your satisfaction.
-   You have had time, if needed, to discuss the plan with family or advisors.
-    You are able to use the information to make a decision that you think is in your own best interest.
-    You   share your decision with your doctor or treatment team
  have gone through these steps and decided to get the treatment or procedure, you are usually asked to sign a paper called a consent form.
- The completed and signed consent form is a legal document that lets your doctor go ahead with the treatment plan.
- The consent form names the procedure or treatment to be done.
- The rest of the form may be very general, stating only that you have been told about the risks of the treatment and other available options, or it may be very detailed, outlining what the risks and other options are. Depending on how it's presented, you may sign for one certain procedure or treatment, or you may give approval for any treatments and procedures that the health provider decides are needed.
-
-   Let's hear from others on how they define this.
-   When you are given the choice of a clinical trial, your physician should give you something what's called informed consent.
-   This is the way to provide all of the information which is related to the clinical trial to the patients. They need to be informed about the goal of the research. They need to be informed about the risk and potential benefit.
-   They need to be informed about the confidentiality aspects.
-   Informed consent is a document that you must go through. The clinical research team will come in, and they will literally go through every page, almost word by word, and make sure that you understand. It defines your rights as a patient. It assures you that if you're uncomfortable with anything that's going on, that you have the right to drop out at any time with no penalty to you.
-    An informed consent is important because this is the document that actually allows the patient to make that decision themselves. "Do I really want to participate in the clinical trial? Is this the right choice that I'm going to make?"
-    There is no such thing as a safe clinical trials, every trials have potential side effects. Again, the patients need to be informed about this potential side effect during the informed consent process.


# 6. Data integrity principles overview.

Hi Monica I understand the data gathered in a clinical trial needs to be collected following strict data integrity principles
 
Could you please give me a brief overview?
 
Of course!
 
- Following the principles allows others, such as regulators in a pre-approval inspection, to fully understand how how the trial was conducted.
 
- To ensure the principles are followed you're required to thoroughly document everything that happens during the trial.
 
Here take a look: (The chat shows the following quote) 2.10 All clinical trial information should be recorded, handled and stored in a way that allows its accurate reporting, interpretation, and verification.
 
- You also need to ensure the confidentiality of the participants' data is always protected (The chat shows the following quote) 2.11 The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects should be protected, respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s).

Good to know, thanks!
