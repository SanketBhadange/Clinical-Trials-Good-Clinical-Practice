# 1. Introduction to Good Clinical Practice :

# What's a clinical trial?

- A research study involving volunteers, also called participants, that is intended to add to medical knowledge.
- There are two types of clinical studies-
- 1. observational studies -  Observational studies are where participants are identified as belonging to study groups and are followed for health 
     outcomes
     Participants may or may not receive different types of interventions such as education or diet and exercise.
     A patient registry is a type of observational study.


- 2. interventional studies, also called clinical trials.  Clinical trials are studies in which people volunteer to test investigational drugs. Doctors 
     use these studies to see how safe and effective investigational drugs are.
     Clinical trials must be done before drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, FDA.


# 2. What are the phases of clinical trials?

 The phase is based on the study's objective, the number of participants, and other characteristics. 
 There are four phases;
 Phase 1, 
 Phase 2,
 Phase 3, and
 Phase 4. 
 
 - Phase 1 clinical trial is a study in human volunteers to assess the safety, potential side effects, and the safe doors for participants. Very often 
 a Phase 1 clinical tan is the first time a drug is being assessed in humans. 
 - A Phase 2 clinical trials is typically done to assess the efficacy of a product. A Phase 2 would give us the first indication on whether or not the drug is active in patients.
- Generally, Phase 3 clinical trials are designed to confirm the efficacy which has been shown in Phase 2 clinical trials. They're conducting in much larger populations in either in the high hundreds or low thousands and can last for several years.
- Phase 4 trials is a trial which is conducted once the drug has reached the market. It's typically done to capture additional information on the drug.

# 3. Why participate in a clinical trial?

- Not only could clinical trial participation benefit you, but it could also help other people get new treatments sooner.
- Without clinical trials and their participants, the development of these treatments will not be possible.
- The clinical trial process is very important to me because I believe it helps advance the treatment of any disease.
- It is the way to contribute to medicine making it from a laboratory into the doctor's office, into the people's cans who need it.
- Even if it doesn't work for me, I know that because all this research and all the data is being collected, that somebody else will benefit from it. I believe I'm standing on the shoulders of other people who made the sacrifices and the choices to participate in a clinical trial.

# 4. A sponsor's view of clinical trials

Clinical trials are important because they are the best way we have to determine whether or not our experimental treatments are safe and effective and can be used as medications to help patients.
 
- Clinical trials can be designed in a number of different ways depending on the scientific question that we want to answer. 

- The most common type of clinical trial design is a blinded controlled study.
- Blinded refers to the fact that neither the patient nor the investigator nor the team of scientists working in the company know whether or not the patient is receiving active study drug or a placebo control.
 
We know a clinical trial has been successful if the study medication causes an improvement in the study endpoint large enough so that we know that it hasn't occurred by chance.
- If the trial is successful, we do four things.
- First of all, we submit it for approval of the drug with health authorities. Whether or not it's positive, we will publish the data in scientific journals and also post the data in clinical trials.gov and U.CT. If the end points of a clinical trial are not met, it can mean a number of things. It can mean that the study was not designed properly. But often it means that this study drug is truly not effective for the treatment of the disease.

Novartis tries to include the patient voice at multiple points in the clinical trial process. Before the trial begins, we speak with patient advocacy groups to get a better understanding of the patient's perspective of the disease. Before designing protocols, we'll often speak to patient focus groups. At the end of the study, we'll write thank you notes to the patients who've enrolled in the study and also let them understand the results the study.

There are three critical groups that determine who should participate in the trials. 
= The first, of course, is the patient. It's up to them to decide if they have the time or the interest in participating in a trial. 
- The next is the investigator or physician and they look at the study protocol and determine whether or not a patient meets the criteria for participation.
- Finally, the sponsor or the pharmaceutical company writes the protocol to determine which sorts of patients should be included in the trials.

There are a number of things to consider when thinking about clinical trial participation. 
- The first is what you want to get out of a trial. Are you interested in learning more about the disease or about potential options for treatment? - - The second are the logistics. Often participating in a clinical trial means you have to go to a study site and spend a significant amount of time there. Finally, and what I think is most important, is to consider the altruistic aspects. By participating in a clinical trial, you help patients like yourself, you help potentially future generations and you help move the science ahead.


# 5. Drug research and development

- Overcoming disease and improving people's quality of life is the aim of all drug research and development.
- The drug development process is designed to ensure that new medicines are effective, safe, and available for patients in the shortest possible time frame.
-  Drug development projects can be divided into two parts,
-   1. the discovery phase, which focuses on laboratory research, and the
-   2. development phase, which occurs once a drug advances past the preclinical stage into human testing.
-
-   1.1 Exploratory.--- Most drug development projects begin their discovery phase with an exploratory period where scientists evaluate the biological pathways associated with a disease to better understand the mechanisms of a disease.
-   Knowing how these pathways work and interact helps identify the most appropriate target for a drug. For example, a key protein, gene, or RNA related to a disease. Small molecules or biologics must be able to interact with these targets and effect a change in the biological pathway. The great challenge in this stage is to identify which targets are relevant, and more importantly, confirm their role in a disease. During the research process, scientists collect data to support and validate the expected role of the target.
-  1.2 Discovery. --- The next step is a period of discovery, during which assays are developed to test hundreds of thousands to millions of molecules for action on the drug target. The most promising molecules will progress into optimization. These molecules could be either chemical compounds or biologics.

- 1.3 Optimization.--- During optimization, if a compound modulates the target in a way that is expected to alter the disease, this so called hit, will be refined to improve its target activity and other desired properties while minimizing undesirable characteristics, including safety risk. Eventually, a small subset of attractive compounds are identified, one of which will be selected as a candidate for advancement to human clinical trials.

- 1.4 Preclinical.---- In the preclinical stage, further experiments are conducted to understand how the drug interacts with the human body. At this point, dosing levels for human trials are also determined. Discovering and bringing a new drug to market typically takes 10-15 years of research and clinical development efforts, costing around $2.6 billion. Following approval by a health authority to study the drug candidate in human subjects,
-
-
- now we reach the development phase. Clinical trial programs consist of several phases, each designed to focus on evaluating the drug safety and effectiveness or efficacy of the candidate before it moves to the next level of the trial.
-
- 2.1 Phase I. In Phase I of clinical trials, the drug is usually tested with tens of healthy volunteers for preliminary safety testing and to evaluate its pharmacokinetics.
- Oncology clinical trials differ from most trials as they begin directly with patients. This is due to the significant safety risk associated with many anti-cancer drugs. Testing such molecules in healthy subjects would be unethical.
-
- 2.2 Phase II. In phase II, the drug is given to up to a few hundred patients with the disease to evaluate its efficacy and to determine the optimal dose. In addition, the safety of the drug and its side effects are evaluated as these may be different in patients compared to the healthy volunteers tested in Phase I. During this period, drug developers may also conduct trials called proof of concept trials. The data from Phase I and Phase II studies, as well as any proof of concept trial, provide the scientific confidence necessary to continue the development of the compound in larger clinical trials.
-
- 2.3 Phase III. In Phase III, many hundreds to a few thousands of patients are recruited to further confirm the safety and efficacy of the drug. Phase III trials study a drug candidate's risk to benefit ratio, advantages over existing treatments, and required prescribing information. If clinical results show a drug candidate can be safe and effective with an acceptable risk to benefit ratio, the drug will be submitted to the regulatory health authorities for marketing approval.
-
- 2.4 Registration. To enable this submission, data from all clinical trials are collected and compiled into a document called a registration dossier. The registration dossier will include efficacy and safety data to support the final intended use of the drug. The dossier is then customized for different regions and countries around the world to meet the requirements of health authorities. This is a crucial step to ensure that patients all over the globe can access the medicine that has made it through the complex drug discovery and development process. Once the product is launched, several activities will continue, including mandatory drug safety monitoring. Other information such as post authorization safety updates, annual reports, and any additional information required by the health authority must be provided at defined intervals as long as the drug remains on the market.
-
- 2.5 Phase IV. The safety and effectiveness of the drug may be further monitored in Phase IV trials, which are initiated after approval and drug launch. These trials gather additional data not collected during Phase III. They may include investigating efficacy in other patient populations or exploring new formulations. While this process has been presented as linear, it is highly iterative. Stages are often redesigned and repeated as the activity of the molecule becomes better understood.


# 6. Who conducts clinical trials and why?

the purpose of clinical trials and who conducts them? 

Well, as you know, clinical trials are at the heart of any work that brings innovative medicines to people with a particular disease or condition. These studies ensure that a medicine is effective and safe. They are led by our principal investigator, who is usually a medical doctor.

As a potential principal investigator, what would be my role? The principal investigator or PI, is responsible for overseeing a clinical trial. Generally, they carry out the clinical trial protocol, which is basically a plan outlining how the study should be conducted. The principal investigator also analyzes the trial data and sends in reports on the results of the research study. PIs are supported by research teams that include doctors, nurses, social workers, and other health care professionals. 

-  Do pharmaceutical companies always fund or sponsor the research?
Clinical studies can be sponsored or funded by pharmaceutical companies, academic medical centers, voluntary groups, and other organizations. They can also be sponsored by federal agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health, the US Department of Defense, and the US Department of Veteran Affairs. Doctors and other health care providers, as well as individuals, can also sponsor clinical research.

 Would our hospital being suitable place to conduct the trial?
 Well, I can go into specifics that make a site suitable for a trial in more detail later. But clinical trials can take place in many locations, including hospitals, universities, doctors offices, and community clinics. The location depends on who is conducting the study. 
 
 - I know the trial is likely to involve some extra effort from the team. I'd like to be able to talk to them about the benefits of us doing this. 
 
 The reasons can vary, but mostly people are motivated by a desire to contribute to the advancement of medicine and help make a difference to patients and society. Institutions for example, are sometimes motivated by access to new technologies, devices, techniques, or medications. A trial can provide greater insight and saw a product's efficacy,. Which helps institutions to decide if a device or medications should be added to their supply closet. It's also better for patients. Institutions that participate in medical research are more likely to follow clinical guidelines and apply new therapies quickly, resulting in better outcomes.
 
 Thanks Monica, that's really helpful. Personally, I'm very motivated by the patient aspect. I look forward to our next meeting. I can't wait to hear more about how we might get involved. No problem, I'll send you a meeting invite soon.
