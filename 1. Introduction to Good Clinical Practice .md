# 1. Introduction to Good Clinical Practice :

# What's a clinical trial?

- A research study involving volunteers, also called participants, that is intended to add to medical knowledge.
- There are two types of clinical studies-
- 1. observational studies -  Observational studies are where participants are identified as belonging to study groups and are followed for health 
     outcomes
     Participants may or may not receive different types of interventions such as education or diet and exercise.
     A patient registry is a type of observational study.


- 2. interventional studies, also called clinical trials.  Clinical trials are studies in which people volunteer to test investigational drugs. Doctors 
     use these studies to see how safe and effective investigational drugs are.
     Clinical trials must be done before drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, FDA.


# 2. What are the phases of clinical trials?

 The phase is based on the study's objective, the number of participants, and other characteristics. 
 There are four phases;
 Phase 1, 
 Phase 2,
 Phase 3, and
 Phase 4. 
 
 - Phase 1 clinical trial is a study in human volunteers to assess the safety, potential side effects, and the safe doors for participants. Very often 
 a Phase 1 clinical tan is the first time a drug is being assessed in humans. 
 - A Phase 2 clinical trials is typically done to assess the efficacy of a product. A Phase 2 would give us the first indication on whether or not the drug is active in patients.
- Generally, Phase 3 clinical trials are designed to confirm the efficacy which has been shown in Phase 2 clinical trials. They're conducting in much larger populations in either in the high hundreds or low thousands and can last for several years.
- Phase 4 trials is a trial which is conducted once the drug has reached the market. It's typically done to capture additional information on the drug.
